### VIM configuration...

... with inclination for Ruby\Rails development.

For plugin management Vundle is used.

#### Requirements

+ More or less fresh VIM (v. 7.4 should be fine).
+ Exhuberant ctags.
+ build-essential, cmake, python-dev packages (or equivalent) to make YouCompleteMe work.
+ Ack (silver-searcher) which is better than grep for great 'Find usage' capabilities.
