### VIM configuration...

... with inclination for Ruby\Rails development.

For plugin management Vundle is used.

#### Requirements

+ More or less fresh VIM (v. 7.4 should be fine).
+ Exhuberant ctags.
+ build-essential, cmake, python-dev packages (or equivalent) to make YouCompleteMe work.
+ Ack (silver-searcher) which is better than grep for great 'Find usage' capabilities.

#### Installation

1. Be sure to have all requirements fullfiled (otherwise you will be told to do so).
2. Run setup.sh
3. You will get an error message from vim, telling you that 'Monokai' theme is absent. That's fine, just click `Enter`.
4. Closely watch the installation process.
5. Enjoy!

#### Update

1. Just run `update.sh`.
